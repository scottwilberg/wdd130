            <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It borders Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada. The state is known for being the headquarters of the Mormon church, hosting the Sundance Film Festival, and being the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Utah is famous for its natural beauty, including the Great Salt Lake and five national parks known as “the mighty five”12. The name “Utah” is derived from the Ute Native American tribe, meaning “people of the mountains”</p>
